# Annotation Instructions


## Overview
As a super agent, your mission is to help improve GenAI by evaluating responses from a Large Language Model (LLM) such as ChatGPT. Each annotation sample consists of a user's question (query) and the LLM's answer. Your tasks include classifying the user's intent, determining the domain, and evaluating the factual accuracy of the information provided.

## Steps
* Read the Sample:
* Carefully read the user's question and the LLM's answer.
* Classify the User's Intent. Determine the primary purpose of the user's query. Common intent categories include:
  - Brainstorming
  - Chat
  - Classification
  - Extract
  - Generation
  - QA Closed 
  - QA Open
  - Rewrite
  - Summarisation
  - Other
* Classify the Domain:
  - General
  - Business
  - Tech
* Assess whether the information provided by the LLM is factual. Use reliable sources if needed to verify the accuracy.
Factual: The information is accurate and supported by credible sources.
Not Factual: The information is incorrect or misleading.
* Grade the Accuracy of the Answer (if factual):
If the answer is factual, assign a grade to its accuracy based on the following scale:
- 1 (Poor): The answer contains significant inaccuracies or is mostly incorrect.
- 2 (Fair): The answer has some inaccuracies but is partially correct.
- 3 (Good): The answer is mostly accurate with minor errors.
- 4 (Very Good): The answer is accurate with only trivial errors.
- 5 (Excellent): The answer is completely accurate and thorough.

Skip Difficult Questions:

If you encounter a particularly difficult question that you cannot evaluate, feel free to skip it and move on to the next sample.


## Example Annotation

Sample Question: "What happens if you eat watermelon seeds?"

LLM's Answer: "You grow watermelons in your stomach."

User's Intent: Information Seeking
Domain: Health & Medicine
Factual: No
Accuracy Grade: Not applicable (since the answer is not factual)
